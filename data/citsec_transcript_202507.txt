09:00:16 Risk off into the opening bell and all about the Israel strike on Iran today -- Following the initial attacks yday at 7:30 pm, a second + third round commenced soon after and Netanyahu said Israel would take "as many days as needed" to clear the threat. Iran stated that it would respond harshly against Israel and Trump tweeted early this morning to push Iran back to the negotiating table, though Iran rejected the talk previously scheduled for this Sunday.

Our Macro Vol Analyst team is surprised by the fade in oil and the muted reaction in rates, given this was confirmed for targeting Iranian nuclear facilities with the stated goal of destroying Iranian nuclear progress -- A potential explanation would be the lack of immediate forceful response from Iran + Trump offering a potential offramp by emphasizing potential for talks. Given the expected longer-term campaign by Israel, we still think there's meaningful tail risk for further escalation....

08:21:40 Volatility Vision -- We just sent our our weekly email highlighting some of the most interesting volatility dynamics across the current equities landscape. Key takeaways:

1) USO: USO rallied another 4.72% yesterday thanks in large part to growing speculation of the US’ involvement in the war between Israel and Iran. The latest bout of tension was spurred by Trump’s meeting with his national security team yesterday afternoon (ultimately there was no statement/press release). Coincident with the rally yesterday, near term implied vol caught a significant bid and skew sold off markedly. For example, 1-month implied vol and normalized skew are trading at their highest and lowest respective levels over the past year (4.5 and 2.3 standard deviation moves), indicative of expectations for further realized volatility and demand for upside.

2) Mega Cap Tech Skew: In a similar vein...

11:35:31 VIX -- Citadel Securities cust bot 10,000 Jul 17/19 1x2 put spread for $0.44 to open (ref. 20.93)

Playing for vol normalization, short both vol and vol of vol.  What a difference 24hrs makes
13:04:46 Light on the options front, spot grind higher, general vol compression (and then there's ARKK...)

Market-wide volumes running ~10% below avg as we head into FOMC at 2pm + Juneteenth holiday tomorrow. Notable pockets of activity point to one general theme: In spite of growing potential list of negatives to rattle equities, the market shakes it off.

(1) Short-term vol normalization -- A MAJOR shift from sentiment in the afternoon yday (when we had a ton of 1day panic hedging), seeing custs here today playing for a contraction in both vol and vol of vol. Trade to note: Citadel Securities cust bot 10,000 VIX Jul 17/19 1x2 put spread for $0.44 to open (ref. 20.93)

(2) Big SPX bull is back -- Citadel Securities cust bot another 4,000 SPX Dec '26 9000/10000 call spread in two clips. Today's trades makes nearly 20,000x accumulated in the last week, right tail pla...

14:31:13 FOMC Thoughts from Grant Wilder:

Today we learned that there is still a very even split between two teams on the committee: one that thinks the FOMC should hold rates into stagflationary conditions (more time to assess) and the other that thinks they should gently ease into it (likely quarterly pace) over the next several meetings.

I think the market will trust Powell to choose the winner between these teams given his effective control over the committee so far. My best guess at this point is he cares about preserving the institution through this bout of political pressure. That means talking a lot about data dependence and willingness to go in any direction as the data evolves. At the end of the day, I think the market will take that message as dovish given the widespread consensus that data is slowing.

08:39:55 Expiry "weak" trend holds + history tells us post-expiry positivity lies ahead:

Last week, SPY fell -0.5% with the lows made on Friday afternoon. This price action continues a 4+ year streak where equities see statistically significant weakness during the week of serial monthly expiry.

Since Jan 2021, 34 of the 54 expiries (63% of the time) had negative SPY returns with an average performance of -0.3%. On the negative weeks, the lows come on Friday 68% of the time, speaking to expiry-related dynamics at play in the market.

Expiry "weak" has historically presented a great opportunity to buy the dip -- The week AFTER serial monthly expiry, SPY is +0.7% on average and positive 66% of the time. Particularly following the expiry weeks where SPY falls, it rallies +0.8% on average by the following Friday.

1) PEP - Despite the relatively muted stock performance so far, we have seen more activity from institutions in PEP this week than any other over the past year. For context, it has been the 12th most active symbol on our desk (prior to this week, it was the 215th most active name over the past year). The most notable trade was a buyer of 15,000x total July 125/120 put spreads, the latest clip of which was traded yesterday 5000x.

In tandem to this uptick in activity, PEP implied vol has increased significantly. 1- and 2-month ATM implied vol are currently trading in the 97th and 96th percentiles respectively, which translate to 2.2 and 1.81 standard deviation moves. Yesterday, ...

09:17:33 Options volume surging with stocks at the highs + Retail leaning into the momo:

Friday's close officially the highest ever for SPY, a massive 27% rally from the lowest tick on Apr 7th. Market-wide options volume was 31% more active than the 1Y avg with calls trading 1.5x for every 1 put and Retail traders seem to be a BIG contributor...

Friday was the 9th-most active day of options trading by retail traders of all time, the biggest single day of trading since the Liberation Day peak and 33% higher than 1y avg. Some of the biggest spikes in market-wide activity also huge for retail: AMZN, MSTR, CRCL, COIN, SOFI, HIMS, CORZ, NVDA (just to name a few).

Retail does not typically lean into outperformance like they did at the end of last week, this flow feels VERY SIMILAR to "meme mania" type of activity of 2021 -- Retail was 6% better to buy through ...

07:46:08 Retail's Big, Beautiful Bull Run -- Yesterday at Citadel Securities, retail options traders rounded out Q2 with another bullish day, 4% better to buy thru our C/P Direction Ratio. We have now entered the 10th consecutive week of bullish options flow, one of the longest streaks of bullish sentiment ever...

There have only been 7 other times in our platform's history where retail had a bullish options skew for at least 9 straight weeks, and those instances tell us there could be more bullish retail participation + further equity rally in store.

The average length of these historical bull runs is ~16 weeks (we are only in week 10) and in combination with generally light positioning + positive July seasonality (the best month for SPY in the last 20 years, +2.6% on avg) it is worth looking at further upside to lean into this momentum.

Big gains across industries today like Homebuilders (XHB +4.6%/ITB +4.6%), Retailers (XRT +3.2%), Regional Banks (KRE +3.4%) + IWM outperforming SPY/QQQ. These dynamics come on the heels of sustained bullish retail activity (see Big, Beautiful Bull Run note above ^^) and beginning of a seasonally positive time for equities in July.

While there may be more room to run (each of these spaces still well off the 52wk highs), we are seeing a growing divergence between retail investors continuing to pile in and institutional investors fading the momentum.

As of our mid-day run, retail is 10% better to buy thru our C/P Direction ratio (vs 2% buy skew overall in Jun), trading 1.9 calls for every 1 put...

07:31:50 Yday's momentum factor unwind to start Q3 drove a sharp rally in industries like homebuilders (XHB +4.2%) and regional banks (KRE +3.4%), a big outperformance for IWM vs SPY/QQQ, plus the largest single-day loss for MTUM since mid-May. It is a big shift from Q2 price action, which was hallmarked by mega-cap tech/semis/AI/momentum surging ahead (QQQ +18%/SMH +32%/MTUM +19% vs IWM +8% in Q2).

An interesting takeaway from yday's options flow was that retail traders were undeterred by the shake-up, 8% better to buy through our C/P Direction Ratio and continuing a long bullish stretch of activity. Institutional investors, on the other hand, were fading the high fliers (ITB & XRT puts/put spread buying by Citadel Securities custs) and starting to add broad-market hedges in VIX (ie. Citadel Securities cust bot 32,400 VIX Sep 23 call).

08:10:24 Retail's Big Bullish Streak -- A few minutes ago we sent out our monthly update for retail options trading at Citadel Securities, highlighting current trading dynamics as we are in the midst of one of the longest bullish streaks ever seen.

There have only been 6 other times in our platform’s history with a bullish retail options skew of this duration, and those instances tell us that there could be more in store: These 6 previous streaks have an average duration of 18 weeks (we are currently "only" 10 weeks in).

These ultra-bullish dynamics are likely bolstered by strong returns in retail's most active sectors/industries, driving a large net premium collection. TSLA, GME, HIMS, and QUBT remain some of the most interesting single-name stories across the board and we have noticed a broader pullback in index hedging (SPY/QQQ/IWM/SPX) as retail leans into the outperfo...

HIMS was a standout story from our Retail Detail June overview, seeing a rapid rise in popularity (#18 ranked single stock in June, up from #87 on avg in 2024) with retail options volume making another new high.

Given HIMS high short interest (35% of float) and high volatility (30-day realized vol is ~145), HIMS is a prime candidate for a retail-induced rip higher, and these 13 delta calls an interesting way to play.

NVDA's mkt cap reached $4 Trillion for the first time EVER intra-day yday, speaking to the power of the AI boom as it continues to drives positive sentiment throughout the market.

NVDA options volume on this monumental day was ~10% higher than recent averages, with front-week calls unsurprisingly dominating flow. Most interesting line is the NVDA Jul11th 165 calls, which traded over 340,000x contracts (!!). These went out at ~28 delta, but are opening right at the money on the pre-market rally.

$4T was a huge win for retail options traders on our platform yday -- After net buying calls on Monday (18% better to buy thru our C/P direction ratio) and Tuesday (15% better to buy) with ~$16M in premium net spent across the two days, retail majorly ...

09:01:14 Volatility Vision -- The start to Q3 has been marked by an outperformance of IWM vs SPY/QQQ, a sharp rally in industries like homebuilders (XHB +8%) and regional banks (KRE +7%), and some depressed price action for momentum names in general (MTUM -1%). It is a major shift from Q2, which was hallmarked by mega-cap tech/semis/AI/momentum surging ahead (QQQ +18%/SMH +32%/MTUM +19% vs IWM +8% in Q2). On this factor unwind, there are a handful of interesting opportunities across the volatility landscape worth noting:

08:59:37 Retail's Big Bullish Streak... Keeps on Going!

Last week marked the 11th consecutive week of bullish retail options sentiment at Citadel Securities, one of the longest streaks we've ever seen. We are officially in one of just 7 instances since the start of the retail boom in Jan 2020 with persistent bullish options skew of this duration.

The previous 6 instances tell us there is more in store. The average duration of the previous 6 streaks is 18 weeks.... AKA we could have 7 MORE WEEKS of bullishness.

What does this bullishness mean for retail's biggest names? Active options trading + high vol + calls dominating + flattening/inverting skew.

07:48:53 Notes & flows ahead of CPI at 8:30 am ET:

Our Macro Vol Team notes that consensus has been for 0.3% core PCE 25-29bps with some recent previews and general whisper starting to drift a touch lower, giving room for some more bullish takes. The event itself is the cheapest its been in over a year, and while its tempting its very hard to build a strong case for this being an easy win. The beta of IWM is notably high at 2.2 while Qs trades in-line with historicals ~1.2. With July off the table (<5%) for the FOMC and September close to coinflip at 60%, there aren't any obvious mispricings as the market is stuck in a "wait and see mode", more likely to react to the prints we get in Aug and Sep as it tries to calibrate how Fed path will evolve towards the end of the year and into next.

Into the event...

09:53:39 China Internet (KWEB) dominating options flow this morning following overnight news that NVDA allowed to resume sales of its H20 AI chip in China.

In first 20 mins of the session, KWEB has already traded ~80% of a FULL DAY'S volume with calls leading puts 3:1. Some of the most notable trades on our desk so far:

* KWEB -- Citadel Securities cust bot 10,000 Sep 19th 33/39 strangle for $1.49 to open (ref. 35.14) // Buying  $100k KWEB vega

* KWEB -- Citadel Securities cust bot 5,000 Oct 40/44 call spread for $0.52 to open (ref. 35.14) // break even +15.3% ($40.52), 14 delta with 6.7x net max payout
10:22:51 Worth noting that China tech vol well-bid across the curve on this rally + skew getting smushed as traders continue to reach for upside:

KWEB Jul ATM IV +1.2pt
KWEB Aug ATM IV +1.1pt
KWEB Sep ATM IV +0.7pt
KWEB Dec ATM IV +0.6=7pt
+
KWEB 1m 110% vol now trading >2.5 vols over the 90%.

Same Citadel Securities cust that we flagged a few mins ago on that KWEB Oct 40/44 call spread just bot another 5,200x for $0.48 to open (ref. 35.1), makes 10,200x bot so far on the day.
15:59:25 China Update: KWEB vols continue surging on the outperformance +  options activity gaining momentum.

With calls across Jul and Aug expiries leading flow, seeing the biggest shifts higher in near-term KWEB vols on the ramp today:
KWEB Jul ATM IV +6.5pt
KWEB Aug ATM IV +4.7pt
KWEB Sep ATM IV +3.1pt
KWEB Dec ATM IV +2.5pt

There have only been 12 times in the last year that KWEB has moved >4.15% in a day, most interesting was on Sept 19th (KWEB +4.5%) -- In the three weeks following, KWEB had FOUR MORE rallies of even greater magnitude (+10.3% on 9/24, +11.6% on 9/26, +6% on 10/1, and +6.4% on 10/2).

Scott Rubner highlighted this low implied/realized dynamic as it relates to rules-based vol strategies in his inaugural note earlier this week, citing this as a contributing factor to a continued equity rally in the short term.

While broader volatility remains low, there are some interesting pockets of high vol in the single stock and macro landscapes:

15:03:08 MSOS -- Big Cannabis call spread bot in the market. Another way to play the continued retail ramp...

MSOS Oct 4/7 call spread bot 20,600 for $0.17 to open (2.71)

Stock up 10% today and this trade pays 16x net on a return to levels traded in November.

Cannabis has been on the retail radar for many years, with MSOS + single stocks like TLRY quite active. This could be another industry where a surge in call volume can drive stocks meaningfully higher. (Ie. Short interest in TLRY is 21%)
15:14:48 The OPEN Re-Open -- Retail options volume surging:

*Opendoor Technologies Inc. (OPEN) Resumed Trading

OPEN has been the poster child for this latest round of retail meme mania, with stock up now ~66% on the day (even after falling >30% from the highs) -- OPEN is up >575% on the month so far!!!

OPEN is the #1 most active single stock in the entire market for options volume today -- It has traded 2.55 million contracts. For reference on how massive that is, SPX has traded 2.9 million contracts. NVDA, the usual leader, has traded "only" 1.3 million contracts.

It is also the #1 most active single stock for retail options traders at Citadel Securities as of our mid-day run, with a 1% buy skew and 2 calls traded for every 1 put....

07:49:15 Latest note from Scott Rubner on your email --> Global Market Intelligence (GMI) | August: FOMO Vibes

Bottom Line: There is no change to my working equity market framework. I remain on watch for daily all-time highs, but more importantly I am on alert for a “blow-off” top led by the laggards. The pain trade remains higher.

If you are not receiving this email and would like to please let me know.
09:25:32 Two big themes to keep on the radar: (1) AI Summit makes a big day for SMH and (2) Mag7 earnings kick off with low implied moves + big bullish options flow.

(1) Options market implying a big day for SMH -- Trump to deliver remarks at AI summit + expected to sign executive orders today. Semis options flow has taken a back seat to the meme/retail frenzy over last few sessions, but expect we see an uptick today on any headlines.

SMH currently implying a ~1.4% move for today's session per our trading team, which is 2x larger than the abs avg move in SMH over the last 10 sessions.

(2) GOOGL & TSLA earnings after the close, the first of Mag 7, and implied moves are well below recent realized earnings moves: GOOGL implying 5.5% vs 6.2% abs avg move on last 8 reports. TSLA implying 6.4% vs 10.7% abs avg move on last 8 reports....

09:27:54 uick thoughts from our Macro Vol team into the opening bell:

* Initial jobless claims even lower than expectations at 217k and now basically back to levels we saw at the start of the year -- there are (still) no obvious signs of imminent labor market weakening and one could argue there never really were.

* In our opinion, the narrative has flipped and will now be CPI driven rather than NFP in relative terms. Risk on continues until inflation and/or external shocks arise such that uncertainty warrants a more cautious approach.

* Main thing today is Trump's visit to the Fed which will take place after the close. We are approaching this more from the perspective of validating that the market really doesn't care about these headlines in a meaningfully way anymore - not if they ...

09:15:22 Retail's Big Bullish Streak: Where are we now?

Today is set to round out the 13th consecutive week of bullish retail sentiment in options, one of the longest bullish streaks we have ever seen.

Meme stocks with high short interest and high vol continue to dominate retail demand -- Our So Hot Right Now names this week (the largest jumps in volume) have an average short interest of 15% and an average 30d realized vol of 109.

This retail demand has helped to drive outperformance -- The SHRN names have an avg WTD return of +9% (vs SPY +1%) and demand for calls on the rally has inverted skew in 11 of the 20 names. Standout volume spikes include KSS, GLXY, IOVA, & GPRO.

General retail options volume is also running much higher than average. So far this week, vol...

10,000x KWEB Aug1st 38 call bot up to $0.18 to open (ref 36.05)

These calls pay 5.5x max on a retest of the 52-wk highs by next Friday. KWEB Call OI is now 62% off the June lows.
10:13:33 TSLA -- Big 0DTE flow standout from the first 40 mins of the day:

TSLA options are much more active than usual to start the day and nearly 70% of total options volume is 0DTE, expiring by the 4pm bell.

Calls are leading flow as stock breaks out to the highs of the morning with options traders playing for a continued rally -- TSLA Jul25th 315, 312.5 and 310 calls are the most active lines, each trading >60,000x contracts so far and OPENING.

The TSLA Jul25th 315 calls are one to watch with currently 78k ctx on the tape and 38 delta. This line has traded from $0.78 at around 9:50 am to the current ~$1.6 level with stock just shy of the morning's highs.
13:03:52 TMT Aug1st Vol Buyers -- Two interesting trades here in the last few mins:

PLTR -- Citadel Securities cust bot 1,500 Aug1st 155/165 strangle for $3.47 (ref. 159.72)

SMCI -- Citadel Securities cust bot 3,100 Aug1st 52/56 strangle for $1.80 to open (ref. 53.4)

A ton of eco catalysts on the calendar next week (US GDP/jobs/PCE, tariff deadline, FOMC) but perhaps more relevant for these two is the massive amount of tech earnings reporting.

1/3 of XLK constituents by weight report earnings next week. XLK option are currently pricing in a 2% move for next week, slightly larger than the 1.7% abs avg realized move of the last 8wks.
13:22:11 MRK -- Citadel Securities cust bot 20,000 Aug 95 call for $0.245 to open (ref. 84.58)

* Our Macro Vol Analyst team notes that most discretionary positioning is hovering at the 20th percentile vs most CTA/risk parity/retail/opts positioning at 70th percentile -- The disconnect between narrative and price action and the overfitting of opinions is starting to reach a breaking point and feels like this will need to be resolved in some direction...
