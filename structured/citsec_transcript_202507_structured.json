Key takeaways:\n\n1) USO: USO rallied another 4.72% yesterday thanks in large part to growing speculation of the US’ involvement in the war between Israel and Iran. The latest bout of tension was spurred by Trump’s meeting with his national security team yesterday afternoon (ultimately there was no statement/press release). Coincident with the rally yesterday, near term implied vol caught a significant bid and skew sold off markedly. For example, 1-month implied vol and normalized skew are trading at their highest and lowest respective levels over the past year (4.5 and 2.3 standard deviation moves), indicative of expectations for further realized volatility and demand for upside.\n\n2) Mega Cap Tech Skew: In a similar vein..."

My best guess at this point is he cares about preserving the institution through this bout of political pressure. That means talking a lot about data dependence and willingness to go in any direction as the data evolves. At the end of the day, I think the market will take that message as dovish given the widespread consensus that data is slowing."
